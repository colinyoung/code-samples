I've been writing Javascript for a long time - essentially, since I was 12. Wanted to share some new as well as old code to give you an overall impression of my understanding of the language.

2012 - This is an example of me trying to come up with a way to push data to a webpage
from the AJAX response itself rather than having to process the response. Certainly
a bit unorthodox then, but it was an idea that we see nowadays in DOM diffing.
I used it on a few projects for things like a live sports score tracker that updated on an interval.
