## Github Repositories

I've been writing Javascript for a long time - essentially, since I was 12. Wanted to share some new as well as old code to give you an overall impression of my understanding of the language.

#### **2012**, `ElementUpdater`

This is an example of me trying to come up with a way to push data to a webpage
from the AJAX response itself rather than having to process the response. Certainly
a bit unorthodox then, but it was an idea that we see nowadays in DOM diffing.
I used it on a few projects for things like a live sports score tracker that updated on an interval.

#### **2013**, `Divvy.js`

I wrote this tool for an application that was consuming JSON responses from an API
that I did not write, but that returned data as described in the readme. It's a small
utility, but was fun to write.

#### **2014**

During this time, I worked for a consultancy on proprietary projects
that unfortunately I'm not able to share my code from. They were also mostly iOS/Swift applications.

#### **2015**, `Dosimetron`
